<h1>Facts About Skiing</h1>


<p>Skiing can be a means of transport, a recreational activity or a competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow.</p>

<p>The word ski comes from the Old Norse word “skíð” which means stick of wood or ski.</p>

<p>After the last ice age, Stone Age hunters began strapping long pieces of wood to their feet to travel farther and faster over snow in pursuit of the game that flourished across Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, 10,000 year old wall paintings suggest use of skis in the Xinjiang region of what is now China.</p>

<p>The world’s oldest skis were discovered in Russia, near Lake Sindor and date to 6000 BC.</p>
